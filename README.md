## Overview

The project utilizes machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression, to predict the likelihood of an individual having Diabetes, Parkinson's Disease, or Heart Disease based on various medical features and data. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting relevant health information and obtaining predictions.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/SabariKameswaran/Tri-Disease-Detection-System.git`

3. Install dependencies:
   - Streamlit
   - Anaconda


4. Run the application:
   `streamlit run "D:\Project\Multiple_Disease_Prediction_System\multiple_disease_pred.py"`


## Usage

To use the application:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
2. Fill in the required medical information in the provided form fields.
3. Click the "Disease" button to obtain predictions for Diabetes, Parkinson's Disease, and Heart Disease.

## Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. In this project, SVM is employed to classify whether an individual has Diabetes, Parkinson's Disease on medical data.

[Provide additional details about how SVM works, its advantages, and any specific implementation details relevant to your project.]

## Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for regression tasks. In this project, Logistics Regression is employed to classify whether an individual has Heart Disease on medical data.


## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-feature`).
6. Create a new Pull Request.

## Disadvantages

1.Giving the correct input only runs the prediction model.
